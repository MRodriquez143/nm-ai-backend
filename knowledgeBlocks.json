    "content": "New Mexico’s Family Infant Toddler (FIT) Program provides early intervention services for children from birth to age three who have developmental delays or qualifying medical conditions. FIT services include developmental evaluations, service coordination, and therapies such as speech, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. Services are provided in the child’s natural environment, such as home or childcare settings. FIT is free to families and available statewide. Families can contact any FIT provider directly to request an evaluation, and no medical diagnosis or referral is required."
